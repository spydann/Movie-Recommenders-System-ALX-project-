# Movie-Recommenders-System-ALX-project-

This project is a movie recommendation system developed as part of the ALX program. The goal was to utilize various machine learning techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences and historical data.

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a movie recommendation system using datasets from Kaggle. The system includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of multiple recommendation algorithms.

## What I Did

1. **Data Import and Exploration:**
   - Imported and explored the `movies.csv`, `imdb_data.csv`, and `train.csv` datasets.
   - Examined the structure and contents of the datasets to understand the features and identify any data quality issues.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned the datasets to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Transformed and merged the datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for building the recommendation model.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted EDA to uncover insights and patterns within the data.
   - Visualized the distribution of movie genres, ratings, and other relevant features.

4. **Recommendation Algorithms:**
   - Implemented collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms.
   - Experimented with hybrid recommendation methods to improve recommendation accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the performance of the recommendation models using appropriate metrics.
   - Compared the effectiveness of different algorithms and fine-tuned the models for better results.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of recommendation algorithms. The final model offers personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.
